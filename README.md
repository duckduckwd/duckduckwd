# 👋 Hi, I’m Ed Wright

I’m a **UK-based software engineer and engineering leader** with a strong focus on **modern JavaScript, React, and cloud-native development**. I enjoy building well-designed, testable systems and helping teams ship high-quality software with confidence.

I care deeply about **clean code, maintainability, accessibility, and developer experience** — and I like making the implicit explicit.

My core values are **communicate**, **collaborate** and **contribute**.

## ⚙️ Current Personal Project

I'm working on an enterprise-level application called [***Onward***](https://github.com/duckduckwd/job-tracker-application), designed to help job-hunters track applications they make across various platforms.

It's in its infancy - there's not a lot to show yet but here's some details:

- Tech Stack:
  - **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
  - **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
  - **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
  - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  - **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier)
  - **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Husky pre-commit hooks
  - **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode
  - **Error Tracking**: Sentry (free tier)
  - **Environment Management**: T3 env validation with Zod

## 🧠 What I do

- 💻 Build and maintain **React & TypeScript** applications (web and some React Native)
- 🧪 Advocate for **testing as a first-class citizen**  
  (unit, integration, accessibility & end-to-end)
- ☁️ Work with **AWS** and cloud-native architectures  
  *(currently working towards AWS Developer Associate certification)*
- 👥 Lead and support engineering teams through **Agile delivery**, including:
  - pragmatic process improvement
  - iterative, feedback-driven development
  - code reviews and mentoring
  - greenfield and legacy modernisation projects

## 🛠️ Tech I work with

### Frontend
- React (including Next.js), TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modern testing stacks (Jest, Testing Library, Playwright)
- Accessibility-first development

### Backend / Platform
- Java (Spring / Spring Boot / JUnit)
- Node.js
- REST APIs
- SQL/NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- AWS (Lambda, IAM, CI/CD fundamentals)

### Engineering Practices
- Clean, self-documenting code
- Strong separation of concerns
- High test coverage as a delivery enabler
- CI/CD and automation
- Agile ways of working (Scrum / Kanban, continuous improvement)

## 🚀 How I work

- I favour **clarity over cleverness**
- I believe tests are part of the product, not an afterthought
- I work best in **Agile teams** that value transparency, regular feedback, and continuous improvement
- I aim to leave codebases **better than I found them**
- I value calm, collaborative teams that optimise for long-term outcomes

## 🏃 Outside of code

When I’m not building software, you’ll probably find me:
- 🚴 Spinning (I’m a Spartan Master Spinner at David Lloyd, Cheadle)
- 🏃 Running 5Ks (sometimes flat-out)
- 📈 Tracking performance, progress, and marginal gains
