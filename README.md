# 👋 Hi, I’m Ed Wright

I’m a **UK-based software engineer and engineering leader** with a strong focus on **modern JavaScript, React, and cloud-native development**. I enjoy building well-designed, testable systems and helping teams ship high-quality software with confidence.

I care deeply about **clean code, maintainability, accessibility, and developer experience** — and I like making the implicit explicit.

---

## 🧠 What I do

- 💻 Build and maintain **React & TypeScript** applications (web and some React Native)
- 🧪 Advocate for **testing as a first-class citizen**  
  (unit, integration, accessibility & end-to-end)
- ☁️ Work with **AWS** and cloud-native architectures  
  *(currently working towards AWS Developer Associate certification)*
- 👥 Lead and support engineering teams through:
  - pragmatic process improvement
  - code reviews and mentoring
  - greenfield and legacy modernisation projects

---

## 🛠️ Tech I work with

### Frontend
- React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modern testing stacks (Jest, Testing Library, Playwright)
- Accessibility-first development

### Backend / Platform
- Java (Spring / Spring Boot)
- Node.js
- REST APIs
- AWS (Lambda, IAM, CI/CD fundamentals)

### Engineering Practices
- Clean, self-documenting code
- Strong separation of concerns
- High test coverage as a delivery enabler
- CI/CD and automation

---

## 🚀 How I work

- I favour **clarity over cleverness**
- I believe tests are part of the product, not an afterthought
- I aim to leave codebases **better than I found them**
- I value calm, collaborative teams that optimise for long-term outcomes

## 🏃 Outside of code

When I’m not building software, you’ll probably find me:
- 🚴 Cycling (including multi-day rides and spin classes)
- 🏃 Running 5Ks (sometimes flat-out)
- 📈 Tracking performance, progress, and marginal gains
